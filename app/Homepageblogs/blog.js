I believe that animation can be a powerful tool for improving the user experience of a website, and I love to use it to create websites that are both visually appealing and interactive. In my own website, I have used animation at various points to help improve the user experience. For Example I utilized the power of three animation libraries: AOS, animate.css, and framer motion. AOS (Animate On Scroll) allowed me to trigger animations as the user scrolls down the page, creating a smooth and engaging effect. animate.css provided a collection of pre-built CSS animations that I could easily apply to different elements, saving me time and effort in writing custom animation code Power of Framer Motion Lastly, framer motion enriched my website with more advanced animations and interactive transitions, giving it a more polished and professional touch.
